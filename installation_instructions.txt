First of all, we must be sure that all shell scripts are in UNIX format and have
executable permission. To do this, we can run the shell script, which scans
all the shell scripts in this project and convert them to UNIX format and give
them executable permission.

$ ./enable_shell.sh

All of the installlation commands are put in the install.sh script
However, I suggest that you should not run ./install.sh directly, 
but instead, you should run the commands in the install.sh one by one, 
so that you can see the output of each command and know what is going on.

Additionally, some of the commands in the install.sh script can be very long,
such as installing gpp 4.8 and make -j 4, which essentially compiles the Kaldi
project from their dependencies
